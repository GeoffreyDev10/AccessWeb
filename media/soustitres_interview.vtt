00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.720
I'm unna and I'm a florist I qualified

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.420
years ago in London and I set up here in

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.270
my current studio in 2014 the end of

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.369
2014

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.799
originally I studied art and then

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.350
fashion and worked in that business and

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.210
then when I went up to London I worked

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.760
in property and I just wanted something

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.370
creative to do alongside the day job of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.430
property so decided to go do a floristry

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.619
course got the bug and carried on from

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.539
there a favorite flower

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.600
yes garden roses which is what I tend to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.120
specialize in using they're the scented

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.780
old english old-fashioned very fluffy

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.700
roses that would be found in a typical

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.210
English country garden how do I start I

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.329
will start with what we call a focal

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.710
flower which would be something like

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.010
your rose or if some people use lilies

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.300
that would be a focal flower so the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.850
larger single headed flowers you tend to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.040
start with because they are the focal

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.860
point you'd build it up with foliage and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.929
then you would add in what we call

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.090
filler flowers so much smaller Bunch

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.130
spray roses tips off of there things

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.229
like that which would fill out the

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.409
arrangement things that stand out

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.329
perhaps if things have been a challenge

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.130
that I've had to come up with some

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.799
ingenious way of achieving the look that

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.499
the bride has asked for that I would be

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.149
pleased with and I will go away thinking

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.399
yes I've really you know I've sourced

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.899
the you know I managed to do that quite

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.969
well we had one the other day at the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.039
crown Hotel in Blandford forum was where

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.079
they were having the reception and they

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.939
had just decorated they have a wedding

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.560
suite and they've just decorated it and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.889
the bride wanted an internal floral arch

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.560
most of the arches I do are outside so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.859
there's not too much issue but because

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.020
it was November she wanted it inside and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.099
I wasn't allowed to attach anything to

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.079
the woodwork or the walls that obviously

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.479
would mess up the newly decorated rooms

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.249
and it was over a big double door and I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.080
had to come up with an ingenious way of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.660
having this arch floating appearing not

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.400
to be attached to anything and what I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.610
ended up doing was

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.920
a wooden frame that actually sat on top

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.320
of the door architrave and then built it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.720
up on that challenge well that was the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.730
challenge yeah that had me scratching my

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.110
head for a couple of weeks until I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.080
worked out how I could do it yes yeah I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.060
think social media particularly for me

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.890
as a florist which is obviously very all

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.720
about visual is essential I I enjoy

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.910
actually doing social media I like

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.480
taking amateur photos myself and it

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.010
could be anything with me out dog

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.510
walking and I just happened to have seen

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.540
something pretty or a lovely view to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.400
having just had to delivery a flower

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.320
and taking a quick snapshot of the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.870
studio or us trying to do a wedding

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.310
where we might have five people here in

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.959
this small space more falling over each

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.820
other and take a silly photo of us sort

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.350
of fighting for space and trying to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.500
create something but yes so everything

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.110
from Instagram Pinterest I tend not to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.060
use Flickr and Tumblr so much now I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.860
don't know how popular those are but

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.170
there used to be but Facebook and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.170
Instagram particularly thank you very

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.380
much
